# FSTree-scan
scan entire file system and save the result in a file. We can confront what is modified from a confront with the previous scan

My project is to have a tool under *nix and Windows system very similar to ls in Linux OS.
For the moment the goal is to create this tool that can be scan entire File System, save the result in a file and in this file
we could have a lot of view, for example the user and group owners, its size express in *B (GB, MB, KB, what we choose), creation timestamp, modified timestamp.
Then, we can have a second "photoscan", and can confront with the first one.
